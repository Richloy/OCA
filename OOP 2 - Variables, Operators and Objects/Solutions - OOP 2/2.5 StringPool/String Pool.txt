 // Assignment 2.5 String Pool

 method1()
 
 Output: M1 The 2 strings are not equal
 
 Explanation:
 
 String mystring1 = "Hello World";	
 << The string is stored in the String Literal Pool >>
 
 String mystring2 = new String("Hello World");	
 << As the new keyword has been used to create the String object, the object resides in an area of memory
    known as the heap. >>
	
 << Therefore the object references mystring1 and mystring2 are pointing at different objects in memory. >>
		
method2()

Output: M2 The 2 strings are equal

Explanation:

<< The equals() method checks the character sequence of the two strings to see if the characters are equal. >>
<< The equals() method does not compare memory addresses, unlike the == operator, which does. >>

method3()

Output: M3 The 2 strings are equal

Explanation:

<< Both string variables contain the same memory address as both are pointing to the same String object in the String Literal Pool. >>
